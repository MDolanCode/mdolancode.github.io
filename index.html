        <p>
          &lt;Hello World!&gt; I am Matt, a 46 year old man who has decided to embark on the journey of becoming a self-taught developer. I am married with three young daughters and currently work two jobs. A full-time job in education and a part-time job in customer
          service for a tech company. One day I realized my life was going by me without having time for my family and so my search began for something better for my family, and myself. I first started out in e-commerce, but after about a year of doing
          that I felt I didn’t want to sell other people’s products. As a musician and self-taught "hobbiest" music producer I spent lots of my free time creating music on my computer and felt at home there. In late January 2018 after some revelations
          in my current role as a customer service representative in the tech company I work for, I felt as though a career in technology would suit me best because I have a passion for it and the income I could potentially earn, so I started my research
          as to what I would do.
        </p>

        <p>In my search I was looking at IT or software development. I checked out the local technology community college BCIT and was looking at the one and two year programs. Although they looked really good, the cost associated with taking those programs
          were high and not feasible for me and my family at this time. Next I looked at coding bootcamps such as Red Academy, Lighthouse Labs, and Brain Station. Although also good they too were too much for us to handle financially. So, then I looked
          at online options such as Team Treehouse, freeCodeCamp, Codecadeny, Udacity, and Udemy. I did a couple of exercises on Codecademy, then the first couple exercises on freeCodeCamp, but then signed up for the free 7 day trial at Team Treehouse
          and I liked it. For the next three weeks I went through courses on Team Treehouse, but realized there were not any official projects to work on unless you did the tech-degree, so I started to combine my learning from Team Treehouse with the
          $25 monthly subscription plus the coding challenges and projects from freeCodeCamp. On freeCodeCamp I made it to the the first basic front-end developer project, the Tribute Page and I did mine on Bob Marley. It was fun! I received positive
          and specific feedback on how I could improve my page which I implemented. Then I came to a roadblock when it came to the Personal Portfolio Webpage and I needed to learn more. I turned back to Team Treehouse to learn more, but I felt like it
          was missing something which was the complete package at that price range.
        </p>

        <p>I started to explore other online options such at Udacity, Udemy and more in-depth courses at Team Treehouse. Udacity offers a Fullstack nano-degree program with mentoring, potential job placement, feedback, projects and more. It is also backed
          by Google and Github, so it looked attractive, but when I tried the first couple of videos it didn’t feel like is was what I wanted. Plus the price was steep at $200 US dollars per month with 6 months to complete, so I moved on. Team Treehouse
          offered a similar thing as Udacity, but it is called a tech-degree instead and was a minimum of 3 months at $200 US dollars. Then I remembered one of my colleagues at the tech company I work for mentioned Udemy, so I did some research and came
          across the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. This course has everything you need to learn how to become a Fullstack Web Developer. It takes you from beginner to developer and it teaches you both the front and back end. I have finished the
          HTML, CSS3, and Bootstrap 3 modules and I am enjoying it very much. It has everything for me, code alongs, projects, challenges, and Colt is a very good instructor too. I am not even half way through the course yet, but I am feeling more confident
          with my skills and decided to give another shot at making my portfolio webpage again for freeCodeCamp. The price was also great! This course normally costs $205 AND you get to keep everything plus it gets frequently updated, but I found a coupon
          using the Chrome Extension Honey and it gave it to me for only $12.99! You can often find it also on sale for $14.99 and the great thing is that is has a 30 day money back guarantee. Now you are probably thinking well it must be to good too
          be true. Well I will tell you Colt’s course has had over 67,000 reviews and a rating of 4.7/5, and when I saw that I had to take the chance and I am happy I did. Like I said I am not half way through yet, but I am loving what I am learning and
          look forward to the rest of the course. Between Udemy and freeCodeCamp I feel like I am ready to take on the challenge of becoming a Fullstack Developer and I hope to inspire others to live out their dreams too. Now I know this isn’t your normal
          “About” page, but I wanted to give something to those who are maybe looking for a course to help them learn like I was and I hope this helps them. Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio website. :)
